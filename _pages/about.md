I am currently a research assistant at the National Software Engineering Research Center, Peking University, under the guidance of Prof. Xueyang Liu. Prior to my position at Peking University, I completed an internship at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, where I had the opportunity to work with Prof. Haihong Feng. I have recently graduated from the China University of Petroleum (Beijing) with a Bachelor's degree in Information Management and Systems.
        
I am applying for a PhD/MPhil, with a broad interest in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Large Language Models (LLM), and Human-Computer Interaction. Specifically, I am interested in Multimodal Large Models, AI Safety, Healthcare AI, LLM-based reasoning, agents and applications, Graph Models, and Human-AI Collaboration.
